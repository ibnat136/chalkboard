##### I learned how to create sitemap and wireframe.By doing this I learned how important it is to have a visualization before we create our website, I have never drawn any wire frame before so the video helped me a lot to prepare for this assignment. I have also learned how to use markup in Read.me file. I have created site map for this assignment and part of the wire frame where I layout out the idea for home page of the website.
